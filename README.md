# **AmpyFin Trading Bot**
![AmpyFin Logo](logo.png)

## **Introduction**

Welcome to **AmpyFin**, an advanced AI-powered trading bot designed for the NASDAQ-100. Imagine having several expert traders working for you 24/7—**AmpyFin** makes this a reality. 

Built with cutting-edge technology, AmpyFin constantly monitors market conditions, executes trades, and refines its strategies to ensure optimal performance. Whether you're an experienced trader or new to algorithmic trading, AmpyFin offers a robust, highly adaptable trading system that will elevate your trading strategies.

## **AmpyFin’s Data Collection Power**

**AmpyFin** begins its operation by tapping into the **Financial Modeling Prep API**, collecting NASDAQ-100 ticker data to gain crucial market insights. This data is used to help the bot make informed decisions and set up trades.

To stay ahead in the fast-moving world of trading, AmpyFin uses the **Polygon API** to monitor real-time market status and feed the bot with the most current market conditions. This allows AmpyFin to execute trades based on up-to-the-minute data, ensuring swift, informed decision-making.

All collected data and trading logs are securely stored in **MongoDB**, enabling quick access to trading information and providing a secure backend for historical data and analysis.

## **Algorithms at Work**

At the core of **AmpyFin** are its diverse algorithms, each designed to tackle different market conditions. The bot does not rely on just one strategy—**AmpyFin** simultaneously employs a variety of trading algorithms, each optimized for different market scenarios.

These algorithms range from fundamental strategies like **mean reversion** to more sophisticated, **AI-driven** approaches. The strategies are continually tested and refined in real-time market conditions, giving **AmpyFin** a competitive edge over traditional traders.

Some of the strategies **AmpyFin** employs include:

- **Mean Reversion**: Predicts that asset prices will eventually return to their historical average.
- **Momentum**: Capitalizes on prevailing market trends.
- **Arbitrage**: Identifies and exploits price discrepancies between related assets.

Additionally, AmpyFin leverages its own AI-driven strategies to further enhance trading performance. These algorithms work collaboratively, with each one contributing its strength to the overall system.

## **How Dynamic Ranking Works**

Managing multiple trading algorithms is no easy task. **AmpyFin** simplifies this by using a **dynamic ranking system** that ranks algorithms based on their performance—both real and simulated.

Each algorithm starts with an initial base score of **50,000** and is ranked based on profitability. The bot evaluates each algorithm's performance and assigns it a weight based on its rank. The ranking system uses a function to calculate how much influence each algorithm should have over the final trading decision. The function looks like this:

$$
\left( \frac{e^e}{e^2 - 1} \right)^{2i}
$$

Where \(i\) is the inverse of the algorithm's ranking. The dynamic nature of the ranking system ensures that the highest-performing algorithms have more influence, while underperforming algorithms lose their weight in the decision-making process. This allows **AmpyFin** to adjust in real-time to changing market conditions.

The system is designed with a **time delta coefficient**, which ensures that recent trades are given greater weight in decision-making, though it is balanced to prevent extreme bias towards any single trade.

The dynamic ranking system allows **AmpyFin** to:
- Adapt to ever-changing market conditions.
- Prioritize high-performing algorithms.
- Balance risk while maximizing potential returns.

## Usage

To start the bot, execute on two separate terminals:
```bash
python ranking_client.py
python trading_client.py
```

Make sure you have collected a few days worth of data by running ranking_client before running both simultaneously

## Logging

The bot logs all major events and errors to a `system.log` file, including API errors, MongoDB operations, and market status checks. You can access the log file to review the bot's activities and diagnose potential issues. The bot will also log rank events to a separate `rank.log` file.

## Notes

- The bot is limited to 250 API calls per day (as per the Polygon API free tier).
- Future enhancements can include adding custom trading strategies or integrating with a brokerage API for live trading.
